I created a word game during Halloween season.  I was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poem The Raven, I created a word game using Python for Exercise 45 of Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw.


Intro:

Once upon a midnight dreary, there was a tapping at the chamber door,
Do you open the door? (select one: 'yes' or 'no')

PART TWO:

>>> yes

The door swings open, in the darkness appeared a Raven above the chamber door.
The Raven then says 'Nevermore.'  What did this grim, ghastly, ominous bird mean by 'Nevermore?'


How do you get rid of the Raven so you can go back to napping?
Select one: 'taunt' or 'shoo'	

> taunt
The Raven gets pissed off and rips your eye off.

> shoo
The Raven flies out the window so you can go back to bed.



>>> no

You ignore the Raven and go back to napping.

Unbeknownst to you, a demon awaits for you inside.
The demon locks eyes with you and you freak out.


Do you flee for your life or passout? 
Select one: ‘flee’ or ‘passout’

> flee	
You run out into the hallway.  There is a door to your right and left.  Which door do you take?

> right
Good choice, you are safe for now.

> left
Bad choice, the Raven flew in here and rips your left eye off.


> passout
The demon then says, 'Well, that was tasty!'

The end!
